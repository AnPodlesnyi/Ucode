        <div class="item1"><h2>CSS</h2></div>
        <div class="item2"><h2>Description</h2><p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. <br> CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. <br> This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p></div>

        <div class="item11"> <h2>Protocol</h2></div>
        <div class="item22"><h2>Description</h2><p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is the network layer communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet. IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.</p>
        <h5>What are the layers of the OSI model?</h5><p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is an abstract representation of how the Internet works. It contains 7 layers, with each layer representing a different category of networking functions.</p><img class="Osi_img" src="https://cloudflare.com/img/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/osi-model-7-layers.svg" alt="Osi img"></div>
        <div class="item33"><h2>DNS - describe all kind of records</h2><p><h6>
            <li>A (address record) - An address record that indicates the correspondence between a domain name and an IP address (IPv4). </li>
            <li>AAAA (IPv6 address record) - Similar to A record, but specifies a domain name match for IPv6.</li>
            <li>CNAME (canonical name record) is a record that allows you to assign a canonical name to a domain for an alias (one-level redirection). </li>
            <li>DKIM signature  (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an e-mail authentication technology that allows you to confirm the identity of the sender.</li>
            <li>MX (mail exchange) - a record pointing to the address of the mail gateway for the domain. </li>
            <li>NS (name server) - indicates the DNS server serving this domain, i.e. indicates the servers to which the domain is delegated.</li>
            <li>PTR (pointer) is a record that "links" an IP address to a domain name. </li>
            <li>SOA (Start of Authority) - the record describes the main / initial settings of the zone, defines the zone of responsibility of this server.</li>
            <li>An SPF record  (sender policy framework) is used to protect a domain from forgery. </li>
            <li>SRV (server selection) - this record type indicates the servers that provide the operation of certain services in this domain (for example, Jabber).</li>
            <li>TXT - record contains auxiliary information about the domain (record of arbitrary binary data). </li>
        </h6></p></div>  
        <div class="item44"><h2>HTTP</h2><p>
            <li>HTTP is a protocol that describes the rules for transmitting data on the Internet.<br> It helps the browser load web pages and the server retrieves the information that the user has entered on the site.</li>
        <li>Information is transmitted via HTTP in its usual form</li>
    <li>HTTP transfers unencrypted data</li></p>

        <div class="item55"><h2>HTTPS</h2>
            <p>
                <li>HTTPS is the same protocol but with a security add-on.</li>
            <li>HTTPS - information is transmitted encrypted</li>
        <li>Encryption was added to the existing technology and it turned out HTTPS - a secure data transfer protocol.</li><li>HTTPS encrypts data and hacker cannot intercept it</li></p></div>
